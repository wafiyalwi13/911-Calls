# 911-Calls-Analysis

Data Extracted from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert), Cleaned and Transform in Excel and upload to Jupyter Notebook for analysis using Python Library.

Using Python, by utilizing powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, revolved around conducting a comprehensive analysis of 911 emergency calls. This multifaceted analysis encompassed emergency service categories like EMS, Traffic Accidents, and Fire Incidents, with the ultimate goal of extracting valuable insights to enhance emergency response systems and public safety.

Throughout this project, we harnessed the capabilities of Pandas and NumPy to efficiently handle and manipulate large datasets. These libraries allowed us to clean, transform, and structure the data, enabling us to focus on extracting meaningful patterns and trends from the raw information.

Matplotlib and Seaborn served as tools for data visualization. We leveraged these libraries to create informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and heatmaps that provided a clear representation of 911 call trends, peak hours, geographical hotspots, and incident types.

## From this analysis we able to identify this conclusion:

1.	Incident Classification: I successfully categorized 911 calls into three primary types: EMS, Traffic Accidents, and Fire Incidents. This classification allowed for a more targeted analysis of each category's characteristics.
2.	Temporal Analysis: I examined call volumes across different time frames, identifying peak hours, days of the week with the highest incidents, and seasonal variations, which can inform resource allocation and staffing decisions.
3.	Geospatial Insights: By plotting incident locations on interactive maps and creating heatmaps, I pinpointed geographical hotspots for each incident type, enabling a more focused approach to emergency response planning.
4.	Trend Identification: I employed data visualization techniques to uncover trends in 911 call data, such as the evolution of incident types over time and correlations between variables like weather conditions and call volumes.
5.	Time Series Analysis: Leveraging time series capabilities in Pandas and visualization libraries, I explored temporal patterns in emergency calls, identifying peak hours, days, and months for each incident category.
6.	Insightful Conclusions: Based on the analyses conducted, I drew meaningful conclusions and insights regarding emergency incidents in the dataset. These insights can be valuable for improving emergency response strategies and resource allocation.
7.	Effective Communication: Throughout the project, I ensured clear and concise communication of my findings through reports, charts, and presentations, making complex data understandable to non-technical stakeholders.
